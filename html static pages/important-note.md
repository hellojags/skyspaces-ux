please check "ux design - images" and "Logo" folder for all SkySpaces design work done so far. 

I have been working on concept, design and features coding for more couple of months.

I am actively working on incorporating new UX changes as per Adobe Design files and making changes in SkySpaces. Its almost ready (2 more days). 

Adobe files along with html/css will be opensourced in this week.
